UNIT TESTS FOR PARSER

What should be tested:
- File tree traversal works correctly
- Python file parsing extracts functions accurately
- Import statements are correctly identified
- Class definitions are extracted with methods
- Edge cases: empty files, syntax errors, large files
- Exclusion patterns work (ignores venv, __pycache__, etc.)
- Multiple file types are handled appropriately
