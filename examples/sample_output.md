- A real analysis of a small, well-known repository (e.g., a Flask app, simple CLI tool)
- All major report sections fully populated:
  * Executive summary with stats
  * File tree
  * Dependency diagram (mermaid)
  * Module explanations
  * Pattern findings
  * Mystery/anomaly section
  * Recommendations
- Demonstrate the value proposition clearly
- Should be impressive but realistic (not overselling capabilities)
