"""
DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS & PATTERN DETECTION

Purpose: Build relationships between modules and detect structural patterns.

What this file should contain:
- Dependency graph construction using NetworkX
- Module relationship mapping (who imports whom)
- Dead code detection (find unreferenced functions/classes)
- Circular dependency detection
- Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth)
- Pattern detection heuristics:
  * Identify singleton patterns (classes with single instance)
  * Detect factory patterns (classes that create other classes)
  * Find MVC-like structures (models/views/controllers separation)
- Call graph analysis (which functions call which)
- Identify entry points (main functions, __init__ files)
- Find "mystery" code (high complexity, unusual patterns, duplicates)
- Calculate module cohesion scores

Key classes/functions:
- DependencyAnalyzer class
- build_dependency_graph(parsed_files) -> nx.DiGraph
- find_dead_code(graph) -> List[DeadCodeItem]
- detect_patterns(parsed_files) -> List[Pattern]
- find_mysteries(parsed_files, graph) -> List[Mystery]
- calculate_complexity(function_ast) -> int
- find_entry_points(graph) -> List[str]
